#NutriFact

A hackathon project done during the Boston AngelHack 2015 competition. It is an application which takes a picture of a barcode, and from that tells the user whether or not he/she can/should eat it.

The barcode scanning is attempted to be done using HP's barcode scanner, and a Nutrition database to extract data and evaluate.

This project was not completed, due to issues with HP's barcode scanner API. The project was attempted in two ways:

 - Native Android program
 - Ionic (Website to App)

The third folder, Allergies, is a simple website, to be integrated to Ionicproject. This website takes in the data from the Nutrition API and then tells the user whether or not he/she can eating depending on their preferences.
